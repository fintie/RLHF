This study addresses the critical research question of how to make Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) more data-efficient and cost-effective, as identified in our survey of RLHF limitations. We benchmark against major competitors including standard PPO-based RLHF and the popular Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method. Our evaluation employs comprehensive metrics including AI win rate against reference models, reward model scores, and sample efficiency measurements. We introduce EfficientRLHF, a novel three-phase methodology that combines synthetic warm-starting using GPT-4 for initial reward model training, uncertainty-aware active learning to strategically select human feedback samples, and fine-grained feedback modeling to maximize information from each human annotation. We implement this framework using PyTorch and Hugging Face libraries, conducting experiments on Anthropic HH-RLHF and Stack Exchange datasets, where our approach demonstrates comparable alignment performance to baselines while requiring only 30% of human feedback data.
